                  I created this project using Unreal Engine 5, using free assets to create a platforming game akin to Fall Guys or Super Mario 3D. You can follow this URL to download it for Windows.

                  I created this project using Unity, using free assets to create a bite size Third Person RPG. You can pick up different weapons, fire arrows and cast spells.

                  I am currently leading a team of 5 developers to create a JackBox style party game that uses your Spotify listening and account information to create a game to play with your friends using the data from Spotify. Here is a sneak peak at some of our mock ups.             </p>

                  <p>
                  Here are two levels that I spent a lot of time with in Unreal Engine and Unity. These were ultimately scrapped but I love what I got out of it even though I didnâ€™t get to use it.

                  My portfolio comes to life through a harmonious blend of modern technologies and creative finesse. Constructed with React, powered by TypeScript, and enhanced by the smooth animations of Framer Motion, my portfolio showcases my expertise as a Software Engineer. With Vite as the foundation and MUI providing aesthetic appeal, this digital space elegantly reflects my journey, skills, and aspirations.
