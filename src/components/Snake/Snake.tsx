          Thank you for checking out my portfolio. My name is Matt and I'm a Software Engineer looking to break into the video game industry.

          Before you get to the juicy part of my portfolio, feel free to play one of my favorite games as a kid, Snake. Just try to beat my high score â€” I bet you can't.

          You can also navigate to certain sections of my portfolio by running the snake into the left, right, and bottom of the play area.
